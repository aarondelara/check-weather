# Check-weather
## Description
I go out quite often and thought that it would be a great idea to create my own app to tell me the forecast of my area. If I see that it's gonna rain in a few days I'll make sure that whatever responsibilities that I have are taken care of so I can spend the whole day in doors relaxing with my window curtains open so I can enjoy the lighting my room gets from rainy weather. I also like to know if I'm gonna need to bring a jacket or if I should wear pants or shorts whenever I leave home.
